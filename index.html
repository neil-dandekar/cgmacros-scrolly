                <p>
                    One in three Americans do not realize they have diabetes,
                    and many of us personally know a friend or relative
                    affected, yet there are few accessible tools that clearly
                    show how factors like BMI, age, and meal macros contribute
                    to glucose spikes. Therefore, we built this webpage to raise
                    awareness of potential health risks and empower individuals
                    to take control of their well-being by exploring these
                    critical influences on blood sugar—and we’re adding a
                    machine learning model where you can input your custom
                    statistics to receive an estimated average glucose spike.
                </p>
                <p>We hope you enjoy.</p>

                        <p>
                            Glucose levels on Day 1 show a wide range of
                            responses, suggesting that factors like BMI, gut
                            health, and lifestyle choices affect how the body
                            handles sugar. 
                            <strong>Some participants had stable levels,
                                while others experienced sharp spikes</strong>, highlighting
                            how personal health factors can influence glucose
                            regulation from the start.
                            <strong>Diabetic participants</strong> showed <strong>larger spikes</strong> than non-diabetics, 
                                indicating pre-existing insulin resistance.</span>

                        <p>
                            On Day 2, people with <strong>higher BMI</strong> tend to have <strong>bigger
                            spikes</strong> in blood sugar after eating. This suggests
                            that body weight may impact how the body processes
                            glucose, possibly due to differences in insulin
                            sensitivity. The data shows a consistent trend where
                            individuals with a higher BMI experience prolonged
                            spikes compared to those with a lower BMI.

                            <strong>larger spikes</strong>, which could mean metabolism and
                            insulin response change with age. While older

                <p>
                    Diet plays a very crucial role in this process as different foods affect glucose levels in unique ways.
                    Everyone’s body responds to food differently and can cause different levels of glucose spikes. 
                    By recognizing how fat, sugar, and carbohydrates impact blood sugar, we gain a better understanding
                     of glucose patterns amongst different diabetic status. The next visualization explores these effects in more detail.

                            Eating more protein results in a small increase in glucose spikes. Non-diabetics tend to have 
                            lower glucose spikes in relation to protein consumed while <strong>pre-diabetic and Type 2 diabetic have

                             <strong>Eating fat alone doesn’t spike blood sugar</strong>, which accounts for having the weakest
                            correlation of the three macronutrients, but <strong>when combined with carbs it can amplify and extend glucose spikes</strong>.
